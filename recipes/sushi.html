    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare</strong> the sushi rice by rinsing it until the water
        runs clear, then cook it according to the package instructions. Once
        cooked, let it cool and season with rice vinegar, sugar, and salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare</strong> your fillings, such as fresh fish, vegetables,
        or avocado. Slice them into thin strips.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Assemble</strong> the sushi by spreading a thin layer of rice
        onto a sheet of nori (seaweed), then add the fillings in the center.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Roll</strong> the sushi tightly using a bamboo mat, then slice
        into bite-sized pieces. Serve with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled
        ginger.
      </li>
    </ol>
